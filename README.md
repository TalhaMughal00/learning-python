**My Python Learning Journey**

This repository is where I practice Python and document my learning journey. I started this to improve my programming skills step by step, by writing small programs, solving exercises, and experimenting with new concepts.

Purpose

Learn Python in a structured way, from basics to intermediate topics.

Practice writing real code rather than just reading theory.

Keep track of my progress and reflect on what I’ve learned.

Contents

The repository is organized into different folders based on topics:

basics – Variables, data types, operators, conditions, loops

functions – Writing functions, arguments, return values

data_structures – Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and common operations

oop – Classes, objects, inheritance, and basic object-oriented programming

scripts – Small standalone programs I wrote to practice concepts

notes – Short explanations, tips, and references I found useful

The folder names may evolve as I learn more topics.

Resources I Used

Code with Harry YouTube tutorials
 – Great for clear explanations and practical examples

Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes – Helped me understand Python fundamentals and guided me through small projects

How to Run the Code

Make sure Python 3.x is installed

Open the terminal or command prompt

Navigate to the folder containing the file

Run the file using:

python filename.py

Progress

Completed: Python basics, loops, and functions

In progress: Object-oriented programming

Planned: File handling, modules, working with APIs, testing

Notes

This repository is purely for learning purposes.

Code may be incomplete, experimental, or written in multiple ways as I try different approaches.
